# devops_task4
Build a Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git

By Guru Sahib Ji's grace tried to solve above task initializing git into local system, then created a repository on Github, which later added to local system as a remote repository. master branch was named as main, 2 branches were created, named dev and feature branch. New files were separately added to them. Plus some files were added to main branch , later dev branch and feature branch were pushed to remote repository where pull requests were created and then merge operation  were performed. Later on local system  main branch was pulled from remote to local and merge operations were performed after  adding new changes to dev and feature branches. Later, .gitignore file was added including its content and atgs were added at the end. Tried to add all screenshots of task.
thanks
